Observable uses **data loaders**, which generates static \"snapshots\" of data when the application is built.

For example, when using data from an external API, the application will take a \"snapshot\" of the data fetched from the external API and use this for computations until it is refreshed (we can control the rate of refresh). This allows for faster computations and use of the data since it has been saved as a static \"snapshot\" and will not need to call the API every time we need to use the data. "
